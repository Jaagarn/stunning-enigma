This project was made as a challenge to recreate a game in Unity3D.

Rules:
It had to be done in less than a day (it was made on a saturday with around 6-8 hours of work).
Three levels with basic state management (you can switch levels with buttons 1-3)
Focus on recreating the game mechanics, UI and look is not equally important (basic shapes are used as placeholders and a simple UI was implemented)

This is the game that I recreated:
